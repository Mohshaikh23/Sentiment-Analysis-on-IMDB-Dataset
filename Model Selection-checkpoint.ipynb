       "0  *Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn't be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this 'film', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don't see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I'll go on for a bit.I don't know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn't matter. They're all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it's film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the...   \n",
       "1  I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this \"film\". How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled \"Disaster Movie\", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being \"Twister\". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or re...   \n",
       "2  Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I'm just going to be making a few observations and points I've deduced.There's just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there's going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" and, \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don't see this movie. Don't spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and ...   \n",
       "3  If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money cravi...   \n",

Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see \"Idiocracy\"? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. \"Date Movie\" was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes \"spoofs\" (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Superhero Movie\" all falling flat.Well I've wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don't see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R   \n",

       "0  * IsenÃ§Ã£o de responsabilidade: eu sÃ³ assisti esse filme como um acordo condicional. E eu vejo filmes de graÃ§a. Eu nÃ£o seria pego morto dando meu dinheiro suado a esses idiotas. Bem, para explicar a profundidade desse 'filme', eu poderia escrever minha crÃ­tica mais curta de todos os tempos. NÃ£o vÃª este filme. Ã de longe o filme mais estÃºpido, lamenta, preguiÃ§oso e inacreditavelmente UNFUNNY que eu jÃ¡ vi. Ã um desastre total. Mas como o meu Ã³dio por este filme e por outros, se estende muito alÃ©m de uma exibiÃ§Ã£o, acho que vou continuar um pouco. NÃ£o conheÃ§o nenhuma das pessoas do filme alÃ©m de Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, e Kim Kardashian, mas isso nÃ£o importa. Eles sÃ£o todos horrÃ­veis, embora eu ache que esse seja o ponto. A ediÃ§Ã£o Ã© horrÃ­vel e, possivelmente, erros de continuidade flagrantes tornam essa porcaria ainda mais horrÃ­vel do que eu pensava. Agora eu sei que esses filmes nÃ£o devem ser sÃ©rios, mas vamos lÃ¡, Ã© o cinema 101 que se alguÃ©m f...   \n",
       "1  Estou escrevendo isso na esperanÃ§a de que isso seja colocado sobre a revisÃ£o anterior deste \"filme\". Como alguÃ©m pode achar divertido esse desleixo estÃ¡ completamente alÃ©m de mim. Antes de mais nada, um filme de parÃ³dia intitulado \"Filme de desastre\" deveria ser, de fato, uma parÃ³dia de filmes de desastre. Agora eu jÃ¡ vi 1 (sim, conte-os, 1) filme de desastre sendo falsificado, sendo \"Twister\". Como Juno, Homem de Ferro, Batman, O Hulk, Alvin e os Esquilos, Amy Winehouse ou Hancock se registram como filmes de Desastre? Selzterwater e Failburg mostraram mais uma vez que nÃ£o possuem nenhum tipo de habilidade e humor de escrita. Infelizmente, tendo sido torturado com Date Movie e Epic Movie, sei exatamente o que esperar desses dois ... nenhum enredo, nenhuma piada, apenas mÃ¡s referÃªncias e cenas refeitas de outros filmes. AlguÃ©m deveria ter informado a eles que a sÃ¡tira Ã© mais do que apenas copiar e colar de um filme para outro, embora eu nÃ£o deva dizer isso porque algu...   \n",
       "2  Realmente, eu poderia escrever uma crÃ­tica contundente sobre esse sanduÃ­che de cocÃ´, mas, em vez disso, vou fazer algumas observaÃ§Ãµes e pontos que deduzi. NÃ£o hÃ¡ mais sentido assistir a esses filmes. Algum leitor por aÃ­ se lembra do filme de terror? Lembra como era original, com alguns elementos cÃ´micos? Havia palhaÃ§ada, algumas frases engraÃ§adas, era uma comÃ©dia bastante esquecÃ­vel, mas valia o preÃ§o da entrada. Bem, essa foi a Ãºltima vez que essa premissa foi engraÃ§ada. PARE DE FAZER ESTES FILMES. POR FAVOR, eu poderia pedir um boicote a esses pedaÃ§os de macaco, mas todos sabemos que haverÃ¡ uma fila de buggers irritantes e prÃ©-pubescentes, jorrando uns forros ruins como: \"ISTO Ã SPARTA!\" e \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\", para que esses filmes continuem gerando algum ganho monetÃ¡rio, considerando que o valor de produÃ§Ã£o deste filme parece custar cerca de 10 centavos de dÃ³lar. NÃ£o gaste dinheiro com isso. VÃ¡ para casa, alugue a Airplane, ria e julgue silenciosament...   \n",
       "3  Se vocÃª viu os outros filmes falsificados anteriores por esses dois senhores horrÃ­veis, deve saber que isso jÃ¡ serÃ¡ ruim. Vou lhe dizer a verdade, se vocÃª quiser vÃª-lo como uma pessoa sem cÃ©rebro (ironicamente para os adolescentes estereotipados, o que eu nÃ£o sou), entÃ£o vocÃª rirÃ¡ um pouco. Mas se vocÃª julgar, mesmo que um pouco, o filme falha automaticamente. Por quÃª? Nunca pergunte isso quando se trata desses dois homens. Lembre-se dos bons e velhos tempos de Hollywood, sempre que fazer um filme era mostrar Ã s pessoas um tipo de arte e tambÃ©m uma histÃ³ria que o mantinha na ponta do seu assento? Bem, sempre que a notÃ­cia de que fazer filmes ganhava muito dinheiro, entÃ£o todas essas pessoas gananciosas apareciam na imagem e Ã© bastante patÃ©tico. Esses dois nÃ£o sÃ£o exceÃ§Ã£o. Ainda temos artistas de filmes (principalmente o gÃªnio Christopher Nolan). Mas esses dois caras simplesmente ... bem, eu tenho escrito palavras tÃ£o grandes, deixe-me colocar em termos sim...   \n",
       "4             Este filme eu vi um dia cedo de graÃ§a e ainda sinto que fui enganado. Ã totalmente morte cerebral. Arrotando, chutando a virilha e os peitos por todo o lugar. Coxo. O que hÃ¡ de errado com a sociedade, que filmes como esse sÃ£o feitos? As parÃ³dias eram todas horrendas e pouco engraÃ§adas. O enredo foi sem brilho, na melhor das hipÃ³teses, e a atuaÃ§Ã£o foi superficial, transparente e realmente bastante desnecessÃ¡ria. AlguÃ©m vÃª \"Idiocracia\"? Lembra do filme que ganhou todos os prÃªmios da academia no futuro? Bem, este Ã© esse filme. Eu nÃ£o vi um filme de baixa qualidade mais ranÃ§oso. \"Date Movie\" foi bom, The Scary Movies pelo menos teve enredos decentes, mas isso faz \"spoofs\" (se Ã© que posso dizer assim) para este ano 0 para 3, com \"Meet the Spartans\" e \"Filme de super-herÃ³is\" todos caindo. Bem, eu perdi ainda mais da minha vida digitando sobre esse saco de esterco de vaca. EntÃ£o, apesar de tudo, nÃ£o assista a este filme, a menos que o seu QI seja inferior a 80.   \n",
